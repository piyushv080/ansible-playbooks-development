In ITIL, a configuration management database (CMDB) is a database that an organization uses to track hardware and software assets. ServiceNow CMDB is typically a critical service within an organization and is often seen as the single source of truth for tracking IT assets.

Ansible Automation Platform is able to leverage modules within the servicenow.itsm collection to both query and update configuration items within ServiceNow's CMDB.

For this challenge, two Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers have automatically been provisioned and added to an inventory on automation controller. Their hostnames are node1 and node2. Two additional playbooks have been created in the VS Code tab.

collect-node-info.yml gathers information about these two new RHEL nodes
create-update-config-items.yml uses the collected data to create or update two new configuration items in the CMDB
View the current group of linux configuration items by typing "Linux" in the ServiceNow filter navigator box and click on Configuration -> Servers -> Linux to view a list of configuration items in the Linux server group.


The two new playbooks have been combined into a single Workflow Job Template in automation controller called: 4.0 - Query node info and update CMDB (multiple job templates)

This new Workflow Job Template line also has a new button that, when clicked, shows a visualization of the tasks being performed displayed as nodes in a map.
Launch the new Workflow Job Template
As the Workflow is running, clicking on any of the nodes should bring you to the corresponding job that was launched for each of the nodes in the visualizer.
